# logisim-8bit-cpu
An 8-bit cpu in logism using only basic logic gates and wire. Uses a custom CISC instruction set with 4 registers. The cpu is capable of basic arithmetic and logic, as well as both relative and absolute instruction jumping, with jumping by register fully supported for both.

Op.txt gives an extremely brief overview of the instruction set.

Insertion sort contains hand compiled psuedo-code for the insertion sort algorithm.
